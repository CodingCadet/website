     <h3><b>METEOR.JS</b></h3>
     <p>Meteor.js is a very new technology that allows developers to use the languages of HTML, CSS, and Javascript
      to build feature rich applications. In the past, web developers needed to know HTML, CSS, and Javascript
      in order to design the front-end of the website (how the website looks and interacts with the user). In order
      for user input such as posts to be stored in a server, however, another language, aptly named
      "server-side languages" such as Java or PHP was required. In recent years, there have been advances to use
      Javascript as a server-side language. The benefits of using Javascript on the server are that it offers all
      of the utility of a typical server-side language without forcing developers to learn a language besides the 3
      necessary for web design. Some technologies to create dynamic websites that use Javascript on the server include
      Express.js, Ember.js, and of course, Meteor.js.
    </p>
    <p>What sets Meteor apart from Express.js and Ember.js, and in general, other frameworks that use languages besides
      Javascript on the server, is that it utilizes the distributed data protocol, or DDP, rather than the more common
      hypertext transfer protocol, or HTTP. HTTP makes websites rely on requests to update and create new information. On the other hand, the
      distributed data protocol system keeps a mini-database on the browser, say Google Chrome or Safari.
      Meteor automatically creates a connection between this mini-database to a larger external server database.
      This means that whenever the information on the server is changed, the mini-database is updated. As a result,
      data on the browser is constantly up to date and synchronized with the information in the server. This
      feature is essential for modern websites, where reactivity is present in nearly every major website, from
      Facebook to Twitter.
    </p>
    <p>Overall, Meteor.js is a technology that provides learners with an easy way into web development while
      still providing the modern features necessary for modern web development. Because of this, wee plan to use 
      Meteor.js to great lengths at Coding Cadet.

     <h3><b>CLOUD9</b></h3>
     <p>You can think of Cloud9 as the Google Docs of code. Because of how Cloud9 is a web application, students
      were able to use Chromebooks to store all of their progress learning web design in the cloud. Cloud9 offered
      two major benefits to students in that it encouraged students to continue their learning at home and that it
      allowed students to collaborate on projects together.</p>
      <p>We created a Cloud9 account for all of our students to login and store their web design practice during classes.
        At home, students were able to instantly access all of their progress simply through logging in Cloud9 again.
        As a result, students were able to effectively reinforce their understanding of web design at home without
        the inconvenience of transferring files with flash drives back and forth from home to Coding Cadets.<p>
        <p>In addition, students were able to work on projects side by side utilizing Cloud9. At the very end of the
          beginner program, students were tasked to create a website with a partner. Both students were able to work
          on the website at the same time, with changes made by one shown on the screen on the other in real time. Overall,
          Cloud9 made group web design work much more effective.</p>
