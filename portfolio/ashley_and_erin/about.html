					<h2>Bob</h2>
					<p class="about">Bob was born in New Zealand and was raised in an isolated tower by a witch. He was forced to grow his hair long so one day someone can climb up the tower with his hair and save him. One day he realized there was a secret exit in the tower, so he ran away and became a baker in our bakery.</p>
