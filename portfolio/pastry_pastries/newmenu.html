 <h4>Desert<h4>
     <h4>1. Croissants
A type of puff pastry from France, croissants are a rich, flaky roll named for their distinct crescent shape.<br>
Typically eaten at breakfast, croissants can be made by layering yeast-leavened dough with butter, and combined with cheese or chocolate.<br>
2. Pies<br>
 A pie is a baked dish of fruit, meat or vegetables, typically made of a pastry-dough crust and often topped with pastry.<br>
While apple pie is a fixture in North American culture, other popular pie flavours include cherry, peach, pecan and blueberry.<br>
3. Danishes<br>
 A sweet pastry and specialty of Denmark, danishes are a popular breakfast buffet item, available in flavours like apple, cherry, chocolate and cheese.<br>
When baked correctly, they are fluffy and crispy on the outside, and buttery and flaky corn the inside.<br>
4. Macarons<br>
Macarons (not to be confused with macaroons) are a sweet French meringue-based confection made with egg whites, sugar and almonds, sandwiched around a layer of ganache or buttercream.<br>
They are round and bite-sized, and come in a wide variety of colours and flavours, like pistachio, rose and salted caramel.<br>
5. Éclairs<br>
An oblong, hollow pastry made with choux dough and filled with custard or chocolate-flavoured cream, éclairs are a staple at any gourmet bakery or French pâtisserie.<br>
They are topped with fondant icing — the same type of icing that is commonly used on profiteroles.<br>
6. Strudels<br>
 A German type of layered pastry, strudels are made with filo pastry and a filling that is usually sweet<br>
Popular varieties include apple, cheese and sour cherry. They are often served with cream.<br>
7. Cannoli<br>
 Cannoli originate from Italy, and are made with a tube-like shell of fried pastry dough filled with a creamy, sweet filling usually made with ricotta cheese.<br>
They can range in size no bigger than a finger to as large as a fist.<br>
8. Pretzels<br>
Unmistakeable with their unique knotted shape, pretzels are made with baked dough in both soft and hard varieties.<br>
Originating in Europe, pretzels can be made with both sweet and savoury flavours and a variety of toppings and coatings.<br>
9. Tarts<br>
A baked dish made with a filling over a pastry base, tarts (unlike pies) have an open top.<br>
Traditionally baked with shortcrust pastry, tarts can be made with sweet ingredients like custard and fruit, or savoury ingredients (often called quiches).<br>
10. Profiteroles<br>
Called cream puffs in the United States, profiteroles are a French dessert made with choux pastry balls filled with whipped cream, pastry cream, custard or ice cream.<br>
The puffs may be left plain or topped with powdered sugar, fondant icing or chocolate ganache.</h4>
