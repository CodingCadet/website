                 <h3> 1 yellow onion, finely chopped (about 1 1/2 to 2 cups)
2 cloves garlic, minced (about 2 teaspoons)
4 ounces (110 g) Italian sweet sausage (or one 7 to 8 inch link)
4 ounces (110 g)  Italian hot and spicy sausage (or one 7 to 8 inch link)
1 large (28 oz, 794 g) can of whole peeled tomatoes
1 lb (16 oz, 450 g) spaghetti pasta
Salt
Freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Method
1 Sauté onions and garlic: Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet on medium or medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook a minute more.
2 Put pasta water on to boil: While the onions are cooking, put a large pot of salted water on to boil for the pasta (4 quarts water, 2 Tbsp salt).
3 Brown the sausage: Remove the cooked onion and garlic from the pan and set aside. Remove the sausage meat from the casings (if your sausage is in links) and add to the pan, breaking up the meat with your fingers as you add it to the pan. Cook on medium to medium high heat until lightly browned.
4 Add tomatoes, onions, garlic: Lightly purée the whole peeled canned tomatoes (and juices) in a blender, and add to the skillet with the sausage meat. Add the cooked onions and garlic.
5 Boil the spaghetti pasta: Once the pasta water has come to a rolling boil, add the spaghetti pasta. Allow the water to return to a rolling boil. Cook, uncovered, with a vigorous boil, for as long as the directions on the pasta package say, usually about 10-12 minutes. When pasta is al dente (cooked but still a little firm), remove the pot from the heat. Drain the pasta and place it in a serving bowl.
Serve immediately. Toss with the sauce and garnish with grated Parmesan cheese.
