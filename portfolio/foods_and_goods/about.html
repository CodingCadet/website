        <h3><p>Foods and Goods website was founded in 2016 by Alex Alvarez and Mahteme Legesse.</p>
        <span>The website was built to be a place were people could order foods and drinks. Also it was made  to be a place where people could see the coding used to create the website. 
         As you all should know, <i>FOODS AND GOODS</i> IS THE BEST RESTAURANT IN THE WORLD. But, we are slowly running out of money and we need more funds to keep this restaurant alive. So every customer has to tip a waiter/waitress and at the very least tip $20 to the waiter/waitress or we will chop your head off :) <i>Foods and Goods's</i> donation jar.
